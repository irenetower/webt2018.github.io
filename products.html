	<h3>IoT Projects | IoT Project Ideas for Engineers</h3>
	IoT has been all the rage over the past couple of years. The extensive use of sensors 
	and wireless connectivity among devices has increased to the trend. The increase brings 
	in turn, easily available technology for hobbyists to explore. Connecting everything to everything 
	seems like a good idea. For e.g. how would you like to control your air conditioner from the comfort of your 
	bed when you forget your remote in the other end of the room. We discuss similar IoT projects here.

		  <h3>ESP8266 based wireless web server</h3>
	  This ESP8266 based wireless web server project is built around an Arduino. Currently, ESP8266 is gaining popularity in the field of electronics because it is low-cost, reliable and easily available in the market. Most documents related to this module are in Mandarin (Chinese language) and information provided in the datasheet is not sufficient enough for using ESP8266 for an application.
	  
	  This IoT project is available at: ESP8266 based wireless web server.
	
	  
	  <h3> Smart Garage Door</h3>
	  Gone are the days when you had to kick open the garage door or use the bulky electronic key which falls out of battery power every now and then. If you would like to keep up with the trend, this project is for you. Designing this project would help you put away that annoying clicker that keeps getting lost. Using a smartphone’s built-in communication technology, this replaces the clicker with your smartphone.
	  
	  This IoT project is available at: Garage door clicker.
	  
	  <h3> Automated Blinds</h3>
	  Automation is getting the best of everything around and even blinders are not spaces. Hilariously enough, if you wish to start setting up automation at home using your own efforts, it would be great to start with blinders. With you can win laurels while they open and close at your will. Happy DIY times are ahead. This next DIY is also being quoted as the cheapest DIY. What do you feel?
	  
	  This IoT project is available at: Automated blinds.

	  This IoT project is available at: Humidity & temperature sensor
	  
	  <h3> Baggage Tracker</h3>
	  When you say that only 1% of baggage is lost during air travel, it sounds like a very small number. However, when we move to absolute numbers, 1% from billions of travellers is still a huge number. The next bag that they lose might be yours. This DIY builds a system that tracks your baggage even while it is in the air. Build it, keep it in your bag and you can track all the details from your phone.
	  
	  This IoT project is available at: Baggage Tracking.
	  
	  <h3> Smart Trash Collector</h3>
	  In real-world use-case for a smart-city, a command centre could monitor the amount of trash in and around an area or city. The respective Municipal departments can optimise garbage pickup timings and personnel required to send vehicles to pick up trash to designated places while cutting down on expenses of fuel and vehicle emission. This next project designs a rather unique innovation using the Internet of things which is to monitor the usage trash in a smart trash can.
	  
	  This IoT project is available at: Smart Trash Collection.
	  
	  <h3>Sign To Speech Using the Internet of Things</h3>
	  Differently abled and mute people use gesture-based communication method to convey their thoughts and the most common medium are hand gestures.

		  <h3> Vehicle Simulation</h3>
		  Thinking of building an IoT-enabled vehicle?  Using a Beaglebone Black, Douglas Wong and the team created an open-source application that gives you an environment to test your potential application. It simulates a real vehicle. And it’s a MUST HAVE if you are creating one of those 26 billion IoT devices.  Because the car that can stop accidents from happening is going to be the must-have car of 2020.
		  
		  This IoT project is available at: Vehicle Simulation.
		  
		  <h3> Life Size BB-8 Droid</h3>
		  If you are Star War fans like us, you would probably like this next project. Here we have a well-documented tutorial for building an awesome Life-sized, Arduino powered, phone-controlled BB-8 droid. The interesting part is, the designer uses household material and an Arduino for a microcontroller. This project does not even require 3D printers, CNCs or milling machines
		  
		  This IoT Project is available at: Building BB-8 Droid.
		  
		  <h3> RC Robot</h3>
		  This next IoT project idea would be a simple answer to how a connected car works using the capabilities of ESP8266. The ESP8266 costing about $5, is a Wi-Fi module with about 4.82 km range with a Ubiquiti M2 dish. So how does controlling a car in your home, while you sit back in your office sound? Should be an interesting take along the lines of building an IoT project.
