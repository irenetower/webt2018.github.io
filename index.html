		  <h2>What is IoT ?</h2>
			<p>IoT is a technological concept in which the objects of daily life are equipped with electronic components, software and sensors and are connected to the internet and to each other. These objects act in an intelligent and sensorial way, and collect and transmit data.</p>

		  <h2>Definiton</h2>
		<h1>Internet of Things definition</h1>
<p><h4>Why Google’s Internet of Things definition is inaccurate</h4><br>
Have you tried to find a comprehensive Internet of Things definition? Surprisingly, the Google answer is the following: “a proposed development of the Internet in which objects have network connectivity, allowing them to send and receive data”.<br>

Wait. The Internet of Things in 2014/2015 is certainly not a “proposed development” anymore! The Internet of Things is REAL.<br>

And Google should know this better than anyone else. In January 2014, <b>Google</b> acquired Nest, a company currently <b>selling more <br
>than 100,000 smart thermostats per month.</b>  As TechCrunch recently put it: “at this stage there’s no putting the [Internet of Things] genie back in the bottle”. <br>
There is plenty of more evidence: Wearable devices like the Jawbone Up have become mass market. The industrial conglomerate General Electric recently<br>
announced that they are making <b>$1 billion</b> in IoT-related revenue in 2014. <br><br>

<h1>Some examples for IOT:</h1><br>

<b>Wearable devices/fitness trackers</b> (e.g., Jawbone Up, Fitbit, Pebble)<br>
	<b>home Automation</b> (Examples: Nest, 4Control, Lifx)<br>
		<b>Industrial asset monitoring </b>(GE, AGT Intl.)<br>
			<b>Smart energy meters</b><br>
				<b>A better Internet of Things definition<br>
					So what is a better Internet of Things definition? <b>McKinsey short definition </b>appears quite logic:</b><br>

<b>Internet of Things</b> = “Sensors and actuators embedded in physical objects are linked through wired <br>
and wireless networks, often using the same <b>Internet Protocol (IP)</b> that connects the Internet.“<br>

This Internet of Things definition leads to an interesting question: If the Internet of Things is not <br>
necessarily part of the Internet as we know it, <b>why then is it called Internet of Things?</b></p><br>
